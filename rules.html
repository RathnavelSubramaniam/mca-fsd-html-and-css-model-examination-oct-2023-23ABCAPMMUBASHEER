    <h1>RULES AND REGULATIONS</h1>
<p>Important tools have been created since the adoption of Olympic Agenda 2020 and the currently Olympic Agenda 2020+5 to protect sportâ€™s credibility and integrity. These include the Olympic Movement Code on the Prevention of the Manipulation of Competitions (OM Code PMC) , which was approved by the IOC Executive Board in December 2015. First implemented at the Olympic Games Rio 2016, the OM Code PMC aims to provide sports organisations with harmonised regulations in compliance with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions (Macolin Convention) in order to protect competitions from the risk of manipulation. It defines violations and minimum standards for disciplinary procedures. Following a wide consultation with Olympic Movement stakeholders, the Code has been reviewed and an amended version (currently in force) was adopted by the IOC Executive Board in September 2022.</p>
