    <div id="img1"></div><br> <p>Sports days (British English) or field days (American English) are events staged by many schools and offices in which people participate in competitive sporting activities, often with the aim of winning trophies or prizes. Though they are often held at the beginning of summer, they are also staged in the autumn or spring seasons, especially in countries where the summer is very harsh. Schools stage many sports days in which children participate in the sporting events. It is usually held in elementary schools.</p> <br>
    <p>In India, sports days are held for 2–3 days. These include games like football, cricket, throw ball, dodge ball, volleyball, track and field, basketball etc. These sports days are held between the various houses in a particular school.

<h5>rules and regulations</h5>
<p>Important tools have been created since the adoption of Olympic Agenda 2020 and the currently Olympic Agenda 2020+5 to protect sport’s credibility and integrity. These include the Olympic Movement Code on the Prevention of the Manipulation of Competitions (OM Code PMC) , which was approved by the IOC Executive Board in December 2015. First implemented at the Olympic Games Rio 2016, the OM Code PMC aims to provide sports organisations with harmonised regulations in compliance with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions (Macolin Convention) in order to protect competitions from the risk of manipulation. It defines violations and minimum standards for disciplinary procedures. Following a wide consultation with Olympic Movement stakeholders, the Code has been reviewed and an amended version (currently in force) was adopted by the IOC Executive Board in September 2022.
